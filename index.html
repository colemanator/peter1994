                        I have really enjoyed learning and working with node.js.

                        PHP was the first language i started programing websites in and although i
                        prefer working with node now i still have plenty of experience with PHP. Ive built sites form
                        scratch with PHP while also spending many hours building and editing plugins for Wordpress.

                    <h2>Prime Number Graph</h2>

                    <p>
                        This was a university Project created to demonstrate our ability to develop and deploy a
                        scalable application to a
                        cloud hosting service. The app takes a min and a max value and calculates the number of primes
                        between those two numbers
                        while also displaying the distribution of prime number on a Graph. The idea was to generate
                        enough load through the prime number sift
                        to educe configured automatic scaling. Although one of the initial reason for creating this app
                        was it would generate load, it still
                        uses a square root sift which increases efficacy. The app is built using node.js express and was
                        designed to be as simple and
                        minimalistic as possible.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Click on the button below to view the app running on Azure however the application
                        will no longer scale due to increase in expense when scaling. You can also check out the project
                        in GitHub by clicking below.

                    <p>
                        This web app uses a number of different APIs to create a much up that displays the viewing
                        conditions for your current location.
                        The idea for this app came out off my interest for Astronomy, i really enjoy using my telescope
                        to peer into the sky above, so i thought it would
                        be a god idea to create an app that could tell me the viewing conditions for my location. The
                        application uses google maps and two weather chanel APIs to
                        to calculate and display the viewing conditions.
